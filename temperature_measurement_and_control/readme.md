# Temperature Measurement and Control (PT100 + Heater/Cooler)

This project demonstrates a basic temperature measurement and control system using a **PT100 sensor** connected to an S7-1200 PLC. Based on the measured temperature, the system activates a **heater** or **cooler** to maintain the desired temperature range.
